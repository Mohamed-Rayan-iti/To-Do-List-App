Using Object-Oriented JS
Developed by Mohamed Ahmed Rayan Miligy

The app allows to:
-Add tasks to the list (from input text field)
-Remove tasks from the list (by clicking the remove button its color red)
-Mark completed tasks (by clicking the √ button color green)
-Unmark the completed tasks (by clicking the × button color green)

The entire app is done in js with classes and OOP. 
There is only one variable in the global scope available. 
Using render function with every change of app state as default.

Additionally: 
-You can search for tasks or filter them by category (all/completed/not finished)
-plus it all sits in your browser's local storage for your convenience.

Error-handling:
-If the user doesn't enter a value in the input textbox and he pressed in add button will alert this massage "This input field is required"
-If the user doesn't enter a value in the input text box and he pressed in search button nothing will happen
